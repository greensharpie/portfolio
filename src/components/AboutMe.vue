        Welcome! My name is Kevin Blanco.  
        I'm a previous healthcare professional turned full-stack sofware developer. 
        Solving problems in collaboration with others has been a part of each phase of my career — whether administrative problems or problems that impact clients that I serve. 
        I have a proven track record of working collaboratively across teams — and through prioritization, always seek out the most efficient path or process to an end goal.
      </p>

        Here a few technologies I've been working with recently:
